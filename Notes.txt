CMake:

command: 
        lsb_release -a    -- give details of your environment that you are using.
        
For checking g++ is installed or not ?
        g++ -v
        g++ --version
        
        
Recommended Way : Write function declarations in different header files.
1. addition.h
2. division.h
3. print_result.h


Build Systems:
1. Make
2. Ninja
3. Ant 
4. Gradle

these build systems are softwares for automating the source code compilation and linking process. 

CMake: The CMake tool is capable of writing the makefiles for us.


Command: 
       To remove content of any folder : to go to that folder : then run :  --->  rm -rf *
       
 
 CMake Commands: 
 1. add_executable(<Exec Name> <Source Files>)
 
 
 Example: 
add_executable(calculator
main.cpp
addition.cpp
division.cpp
print_result.cpp  
)




Note: C++ Project has some sense of hierarchy structure so that we can tell which file depending on which file.
For our case: main.cpp file depends on three files --> addition.cpp , division.cpp and print_result.cpp
